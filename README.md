# <Web-Developer-Portfolio>

## Description

In this project I was tasked  with creating a personal web developer portfolio, something that looked clean but also responsive to provide a catelog of my work and projects for employers to view. In this project I learned the importance of flexbox design and became more intune with styling in CSS as a whole.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

The first steps towards installing my project where to write up a wireframe, in my case I used pencil and paper since I already had a great idea for my layout. 

Now I must create a safe repository to save my files to. Using the terminal and GitHub I can create a commit all changes to my live repository. I will do this as often as I can throughout the entire project.

After i had some heading to my idea the next appropriate step was to create a detailed semantic HTML. In this case I have a head followed by a body and within this body are semantic tags including a header with a navbar, a main section with multiple sub sections to represent pages within the HTML and lastly a footer to close off my webpage.

The HTML is not completely finished at this point but it then becomes important to add a link to a CSS file where I implement styles to elements, classes, and ID's.

I have now gotten my web page to look pretty but only on a desktop screen, it is also important to have a resposive design. I achieved this by using flexbox containers, percentages, rem, and media queries.

## Usage

You can find my webpage at https://ajsherrill2.github.io/AS-Developer-Portfolio/



Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
